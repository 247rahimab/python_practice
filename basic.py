A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
    * A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    * A variable name cannot start with a number
    * A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
